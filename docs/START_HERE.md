# Singularity Docs – START_HERE

Docs are short and actionable for AI agents. Each folder has an `index.md` with links and brief descriptions.

- overview/ — service overview, main files and scripts.
- setup/ — how to run locally and via Compose, environment variables.
- ws/ — WebSocket server, message flow, quick testing.
- protocol/ — message types and constants.
- agents/ — OpenRouter integration, PM and fallback.
- environment/ — variables and integration with `cosmic`/`infra`.
- tech/ — stack, dependencies and TypeScript configs.

Read and follow `./RULES_FOR_DOCS.md` before creating or updating documents.
