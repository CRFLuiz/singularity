# RULES_FOR_DOCS

- Use relative links between documents (e.g., `./index.md`).
- Reference code paths (no line numbers), e.g., `singularity/src/server.ts`.
- Avoid secrets and credentials; never expose values.
- Maintain a single source per topic; avoid duplication.
- Write concisely and factually; focus on agent execution.
- Update indexes when new files are created.
